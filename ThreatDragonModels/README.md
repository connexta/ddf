# Threat Models
This directory holds the threat models for this repository, which are built by [Threat Dragon](http://docs.threatdragon.org/) and stored as json files.

## Threat Dragon Usage
Threat Dragon can be used as a webapp or a desktop application.

In the [webapp version](https://threatdragon.org/#/threatmodel), you will only be able to view or edit threat models in Github repositories/forks that you have push access to.
NOTE: Editing and then saving a threat model will push commits onto the corresponding Git branch.

In the [desktop application](https://github.com/mike-goodwin/owasp-threat-dragon-desktop/releases), threat models are opened from the local file system.
NOTE: Copying and/ore pasting do not work in the desktop application (verified on OSX).
